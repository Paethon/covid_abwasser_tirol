# Covid Abwasser Tirol Mastodon Bot
A mastodon bot that regularly checks the Covid sewage analysis and posts the current graph if it has changed

The data is scraped from [here](https://www.tirol.gv.at/umwelt/wasserwirtschaft/abwasser-monitoring-tirol/) using [shot-scraper](https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper) as a python library and [Mastodon.py](https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py) to post a toot.
